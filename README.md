# TODO App

As part of a Dev Academy Aotearoa project, I was challenged to complete and deploy a full-stack application using a provided boilerplate and styling. I built a functional "to-do" app that lists tasks and their status. This project gave me hands-on experience with both frontend and backend development, and I successfully deployed it using Dokku, marking my first time deploying a project.
