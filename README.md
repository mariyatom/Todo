# TODO App

As part of a Dev Academy Aotearoa project, I was challenged to complete and deploy a full-stack application using a provided boilerplate and styling. I built a functional "to-do" app that lists tasks and their status. This project gave me hands-on experience with both frontend and backend development, and I successfully deployed it using Dokku, marking my first time deploying a project.

### Tech stack:

 - Node.js
 - React
 - ReactQuery
 - TypeScript
 - SCSS
 - Knex
 - SQLite3
 - Express
 - Superagent
 - Vite
 - Dokku

### Status:

This application is 93% complete. A user can perform the four CRUD operations (create, read, update, and delete).

### Learnings:

Building a full-stack application from scratch
Prop drilling into sub-components in React
Preparing an application for production
Deploying a full-stack application into production using Dokku
